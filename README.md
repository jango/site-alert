##Site Alert Chrome Extension

I wrote this to alert me when I am accessing sites on which I should be careful: sometimes production systems look deceptively similar to a test environment. When you activate this extension, you can specify a list of alert URLs and alert messages that you want to see when visiting those pages. Next time you visit a site that has an alert setup, an alert bar will appear at the top of the page alerting you that you should not mess around.

Enjoy!
